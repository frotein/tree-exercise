the tree exercise given to me by NeuroScouting 

Description
============

if we are at an edge of the tree addd 1 to the end (because the farthest branch is always 1) 
then add 1 to the next inner branch as to get that branch on the next level
If were not on the end, the next two branches equal the addition of each branch to  1. the number to the left
and 2. the number to the right

To Run this script, run it in command prompt then give it a non negative integer when prompted for an input
